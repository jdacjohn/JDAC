								<h6>SEO & Analytics</h6>
								<p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Analytics are key to a successful on-line presence. More and more people today
                rely on the internet to initiate purchases.  Fewer and fewer rely on telephone books that are updated only once per year. 
                If your business website has not been optimized, or was not built with SEO as a goal, your business is missing out on potential sales opportunities. If you
                feel that your business website should be driving more business than it does, 
                <a href='<?php print($siteRoot); ?>/contact' class='link1i'>Contact JDAC Computing Solutions</a>.</p>
